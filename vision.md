# Vision

This document lays out the vision for this code.

It is envisioned that this code can be used in many ways to assist with the creation of edX courses.


## XML Validation

* Before loading an XML course into Studio, this code can check the XML structure for any errors.

* When loading an XML course into Studio, edX could automatically run this code over the course, and produce an error report.

* Studio could have a button somewhere that triggers validation by this code (likely after export).

* For github workflows, a hook could be added to run this script upon branch push.

* This code can be used for error detection by educational technologists to simplify their bug sleuthing.


## Report Generation and Course Parsing

* Content reports can be generated by this tool, as shown in crawler.py.

* Because this code contains a full course parser, it can be used in research settings to scan through a course using python data structures.


## edX Buy-in

* edX can use a tool such as this to define their OLX schema. When creating new options, they can be validated by this tool.


## A Living Repository

* When new types of errors are found, they can be coded in here to automatically detect such errors in the future.
