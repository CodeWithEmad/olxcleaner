To be implemented"

On course load:
- course.xml is not named course.xml
- error loading XML file (or HTML file)
- forbidden/unknown tag inside tag
- pointer tag does not point to an existing file
- content contained in non-content tag
- pointer tag points to file that doesn't open with matching tag
- tag is not a pointer tag, but target file exists anyway
- target tag contains an unnecessary url_name attribute
- course.xml is a pointer file containing three attributes, or not a pointer file
- course.xml is empty?

On policy load:
- policy file not found
- error loading policy json
- grade file not found
- error loading grading policy json

On parsing:
- missing url_name
- duplicate url_name
- missing display_name
- obsolete components
- tag is empty; expected it to contain something
- course tag must have three specific components
- test internal links, including static folder image, css, js, and textbook pdfs
- python runs?
- python wrapped in CDATA
- python has correct script type
- everything works when using expect values in customresponse

How does the thing deal with comments?
